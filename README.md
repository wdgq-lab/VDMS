This repository presents the detailed code implementation of the VDMS Model, specifically designed for high-accuracy PM2.5 concentration prediction. We leverage satellite imagery and corresponding ground-level PM2.5 observation data sourced from Beijing to construct and train this innovative predictive model.

The VDMS Model's core strength lies in its integration of several cutting-edge deep learning techniques:

Vision Transformer (ViT) Model: Utilized for extracting rich spatial features from high-resolution satellite imagery.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: Effectively capture dynamic changes and long-term dependencies within time-series data.

Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism: Further enhances the model's ability to understand complex spatiotemporal relationships.

SimCLR Algorithm: Applied to improve the robustness and representation capabilities of image features through contrastive learning.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how these powerful components can be combined to build an efficient and accurate PM2.5 prediction system, offering support for environmental monitoring and air quality management. We welcome you to explore the code, reproduce the results, and investigate further enhancements.
